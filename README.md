# Vx
Experimental programming language that compiles to jsx developed in V.

# Why
Just to see how productive I can be when using V to develop a programming language without caring about strict memory safety like in Rust.

# Verdict
Apparently in a day, I managed to finish nice enough compiler that supports the features below, which is wonderful! <3 (It might also be because I now have prior knowledge to building compiler, unlike the time I started working on Zac)

- variables
- arrays
- functions
- return statement
- if statement
- numbers
- strings
- binary operations
